I attended the MAA North Central Sectional Conference at Concordia University in Fall 2019. I gave a talk on the current results of my research. I will attach the presentation and two animations I used in the presentation. These results are from the research I did with Bruce Peckham in the Summer of 2019. Since then I have expanded on  many things I talked about in this presentation. I plan on attending the MAA North Central Sectional Conference and talking again.
