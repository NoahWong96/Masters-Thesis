I attended the MAA North Central Sectional Conference at Concordia University in Fall 2019. I gave a talk on the current results of my research. I will attach the presentation and two animations I used in the presentation. These results are from the research I did with Bruce Peckham in the Summer of 2019. Since then I have expanded on  many things I talked about in this presentation. I plan on attending the MAA North Central Sectional Conference and talking again.

The presentation was written in Latex with Beamer. Most of the images were created with my programs written in Matlab or taken from Desmos. The gifs were compiled from images I generated in Matlab.
