Dynamics of Newton's Method for a Nonanalytical Perturbation on a Complex Quadratic Function


This repo is to hold and organize the work I've done on my Master's Thesis. I had two advisors Bruce Peckham and Richard Buckalew. This was done when I was attending University of Minnesota Duluth's Applied and Computational Mathematics Masters Program. I started in the Summer of 2019 and finished in the following May.
